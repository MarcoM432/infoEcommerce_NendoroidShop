                     Orochimaru seeks immortality so that he might live all of the lives necessary to accomplish his task. After being caught red-handed performing unethical 
                     experiments on his fellow citizens for the sake of this immortality, Orochimaru defected from Konoha rather than be persecuted for his ambitions, and for
                      many years sought the village's destruction in order to take revenge and demonstrate what he had learned. After several apparent deaths in the pursuit of
                       his goals, Orochimaru realises his approach is flawed through Kabuto Yakushi, his former associate, and begins monitoring the choices and actions of his 
                       former apprentice, Sasuke Uchiha.</div>
