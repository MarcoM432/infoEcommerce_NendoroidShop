                           featuring Sasuke's Susanoo together with effect parts to complete Sasuke's impressive appearance when he fully awakened his Mangekyou Sharingan are also included!! 
                           In addition, 'Union Sign' hand parts for Sasuke and Naruto are included allowing you 
                        to display the two of them forming the Union Sign that they were never able to complete themselves in the series - recreate the scene that never was in Nendoroid size!.
